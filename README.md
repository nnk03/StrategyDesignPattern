# Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime by defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one as a separate strategy, and making them interchangeable. This pattern promotes flexibility and maintainability by allowing different algorithms to be used interchangeably without altering the client code. It is particularly useful when you have multiple ways to perform a specific task. This repository provides an example of Sorting using the Strategy Design Pattern
